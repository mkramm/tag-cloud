# Tag Cloud React App

This repository contains a simple React application that generates a tag cloud based on the frequency of tags from a predefined data array. The application comprises separate React components for the tag cloud and individual tags. The tag cloud scales the font size of tags according to their frequency, providing a visual representation of the most commonly used tags.

## Usage

To run the application:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the project directory.
3. Install dependencies: `npm install`.
4. Start the development server: `npm start`.

## File Structure

- `src/data.ts`: Contains the predefined data array.
- `src/component/Tag.tsx`: Component for individual tags.
- `src/container/TagCloud.tsx`: Component to generate the tag cloud.
- `src/App.tsx`: Main application component.
- `src/index.tsx`: Entry point of the application.
- `src/index.css`: Stylesheet for the tag cloud.

## Technologies Used

- React
- TypeScript
- CSS
